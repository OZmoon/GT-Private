## Growtopia Private Server
This is CA-PS Source Code (OLD) January 2023
So I decided to make it public here. Because I am the owner or who create this project, and using template on Internet, and I can do whatever I want to make this public or private

## How to use/build? 
Same way with other Private Server Just watch on YT Tutorial 
- Make sure that Visual Studio Community is installed
- If you're looking for [Core](https://github.com/OZmoon/GT-Private/releases/tag/v0.1.0) File

## Conclusion
- This project not same as the original, i don't care about the issue or bug. i just want to make it public
- Use this project as a template if you want to make a Growtopia Server. You can add features according to the logic of your code
- i won't update the code if there an error or backdoor!.
